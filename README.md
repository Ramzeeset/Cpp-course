**Archiver in C**

C archiver using Huffman code.

Haffman.c describes functions for encoding / decoding. The main.c describes the functions for writing / reading files into the archive

arc --file *name* --create *file1* *fil2* ... <- create archive

arc --file *name* --list <- list of filenames in archive

arc --file *name* --extract <- extract 

**Intrusive List**

An intrusive List is a container that is a doubly linked list. Unlike std :: list, it does not make copies of the elements inserted into the list, but builds a list of those objects that are passed to it in insert, push_front and push_back.
